This is a template for websites implemented using Jekyll.

{% include "base/readme/install_dependencies.md" %}

{% set install_params_python = {} %}
{% for version_available in readme.python_versions %}
{% if version_available.version == python.version %}
{% set install_params_python = install_params_python.update(version_available) %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
## Building and Serving the Site

Invoke automation is provided for building the site.

If it is not already active, you need to re-activate the virtual environment.
From the working directory of our project:

    {{ install_params_python.virtual_environment_name }}\Scripts\activate.bat

To build the site:

    invoke build_test

To build and serve the site on `localhost:4000`, continuously updating based on changes:

    invoke serve_test
